# Solar System

## Description

This application is a collection of the planets in the Milky Way Galaxy.  When the user arrives at the site they will see all 8 planet names.  When the user hovers over the cards the planet image will display and the user will no longer see the planet name.  When they mouseout they will see the plnaet name again.

If the user would like to know more about the planet they can click on the planet they wish to know more about and a larger card will pop up in place of the collection of cards previously shown.

Once they are done viewing the individual planet they can click the "X" button and close the larger planet card.

If the user wishes, they can use the search feature at the top to type text.  This text will look through the planet names and the planet descriptions and display only the planets with text matching the user's input.  These planets will filter as the user is typing.  If the user deletes the text all of the cards will appear again.
